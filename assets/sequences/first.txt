What a strange place I'm in...
#I remember this orb I found...
It granted me speed, vision,|and a fleeting sense of control.|               |This place may hold more of these mysterious items.
Will I seek them out?|               |Or will I chart my own path?
The journey begins.|               |What secrets lie hidden in the shadows?|               |Only time will tell.
