I think...|               |I think that I remember something
Fragments of my past...|               |I remember taking an orb...|               |then nothing.
I don't know why, but I'm under the impression|that I have to go deeper to find out.
The creatures didn't seem hostile|unless I attacked them first...|               |I hope it stays this way|in the future...
